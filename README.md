# Travel Assistant based on CloudFlareLLM Chat Application Template

This project is a Travel Assistant chatbot built using Cloudflare Workers and the LLM Chat App template. It leverages the Cloudflare Worker AI framework and provides a conversational travel assistant experience.

Features

- Conversational AI: Handles chat requests using a large language model (LLM).
- Session Memory: Remembers past messages within the same chat session for contextual conversations.
- Custom System Prompt: Modified the system prompt to behave as a travel assistant.
- UI Template: Retains the same user interface template provided by the Cloudflare Worker AI Chat App.
- Updated Fetch Requests: Modified the way fetch requests are handled in the code to better suit the Travel Assistant functionality.

Implementation

-Built directly in Cloudflare Workers using the LLM Chat App template.
   Code modifications include:
      -Adjusted system prompt to align with travel assistant behavior.
      -Enhanced chat handling to maintain context across messages in a session.
      -Integrated session-based memory to provide better, continuous conversation.
      -Changed the fetch request implementation to improve data handling and interaction with the LLM API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- A Cloudflare account with Workers AI access

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/templates.git
   cd templates/llm-chat-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate Worker type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm run cf-typegen
   ```

### Development

Start a local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8787.

Note: Using Workers AI accesses your Cloudflare account even during local development, which will incur usage charges.

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Monitor

View real-time logs associated with any deployed Worker:

```bash
npm wrangler tail
```

## How It Works

### Backend

The backend is built with Cloudflare Workers and uses the Workers AI platform to generate responses. The main components are:

1. **API Endpoint** (`/api/chat`): Accepts POST requests with chat messages and streams responses
2. **Streaming**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming of AI responses
3. **Workers AI Binding**: Connects to Cloudflare's AI service via the Workers AI binding

### Frontend

The frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that:

1. Presents a chat interface
2. Sends user messages to the API
3. Processes streaming responses in real-time
4. Maintains chat history on the client side

## Customization

### Changing the Model

To use a different AI model, update the `MODEL_ID` constant in `src/index.ts`. You can find available models in the [Cloudflare Workers AI documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).

### Using AI Gateway

The template includes commented code for AI Gateway integration, which provides additional capabilities like rate limiting, caching, and analytics.

To enable AI Gateway:

1. [Create an AI Gateway](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway) in your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Uncomment the gateway configuration in `src/index.ts`
3. Replace `YOUR_GATEWAY_ID` with your actual AI Gateway ID
4. Configure other gateway options as needed:
   - `skipCache`: Set to `true` to bypass gateway caching
   - `cacheTtl`: Set the cache time-to-live in seconds

Learn more about [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/).

### Modifying the System Prompt

The default system prompt can be changed by updating the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant in `src/index.ts`.

### Styling

The UI styling is contained in the `<style>` section of `public/index.html`. You can modify the CSS variables at the top to quickly change the color scheme.
