During the development of this Cloudflare Worker AI Travel Assistant project, I used ChatGPT to assist with coding, debugging, and documentation. The following summarizes the prompts and guidance I requested from the AI:

-Creating a Cloudflare Worker AI project:
  I asked how to create a Cloudflare Worker AI project using the LLM Chat App template and how to connect it to GitHub, including deployment instructions and project structure.

-Modifying the system prompt for Travel Assistant behavior:
  I requested a detailed system prompt that would make the chatbot behave as a travel assistant, providing travel advice, maintaining session memory, and responding in a friendly and conversational tone.
  
-Handling chat requests and session memory:
  I asked for guidance on modifying the Worker AI code to remember previous chat messages within a session, so the chatbot could maintain context across multiple messages.
  
-Updating fetch request handling:
  I requested an example of how to modify fetch requests to the LLM API to improve reliability and data handling, including headers, JSON body, and integration with the chat system.
  
-Writing project documentation and README:
  I asked for help writing a professional README.md that highlights project features, implementation details, LLM integration, session memory, UI template, and deployment instructions.
  
-Structuring the repository for the Cloudflare AI assignment:
  I requested guidance on structuring my GitHub repository to meet assignment requirements, including naming conventions, README.md, PROMPTS.md, and deployment instructions for fast-track review.
  
-Creating a GitHub repository by connecting the Cloudflare Worker:
  I asked how to link my Cloudflare Worker project to GitHub, including step-by-step instructions for connecting the Worker from the Cloudflare dashboard to a new or existing repository, ensuring the repository name follows the cf_ai_ assignment convention, and managing syncing changes between Cloudflare and GitHub.
